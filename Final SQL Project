--For this project I downloaded the chinook database to SQLite and then performed basic queries to look at all the tables. 
Then I used the following questions and inqueries to form my queries:




--#1 I selected all the customers not from the USA

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != "USA"

---Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

---Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, Country
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

---Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

---Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices


---Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers  cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


---Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.Firstname, emp.Lastname
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId

---How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

---What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

---Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId

---Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name,t.Composer 
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId

---Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name as Song, a.Title as Album, m.name as MediaType, g.name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON t.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON t.MediaTypeId = m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId

---Show the total sales made by each sales agent. 
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, 
ROUND (SUM(inv.Total),2) 
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName


--Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, 
ROUND (SUM(inv.Total),2) 
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND (SUM(inv.Total),2) DESC LIMIT 1
