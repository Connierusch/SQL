# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#I first searched what songs by Bad Bunny (3), Dua Lipa (2), The Weeknd (2), and Masked Wolf (1) were on the top 50 List by switching out the name in WHERE.
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB."Spotifydata "
WHERE artist_name='Bad Bunny'
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I searched which songs and artists had a popularity over 90.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB."Spotifydata "
WHERE popularity >90
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name, popularity

#Next I searched all of the below with the most popular at the top of the list. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB."Spotifydata "
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy
ORDER BY (popularity)desc 

#My final search was for a song with the most danceability.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB."Spotifydata "
WHERE danceability>0.9
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name, danceability
